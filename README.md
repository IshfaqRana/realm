# couchbase_database

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

When using Realm Sync with MongoDB, data is synchronized between a local Realm database on the client device and a MongoDB Atlas cluster in the cloud. Here's an overview of the process:

The client application connects to a local Realm database on the device.
The Realm Sync client library is initialized and configured to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster in the cloud.
The client application reads and writes data to the local Realm database, as if it were a local database.
When data changes are made in the local Realm database, the Sync client library captures those changes and sends them to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.
The MongoDB Atlas cluster stores the data in a MongoDB collection, as BSON documents.
Any changes made to the data in the MongoDB Atlas cluster are pushed back to the client device via the Sync client library, which updates the local Realm database on the device.
This synchronization process is designed to be fast, efficient, and reliable, allowing data to be shared between devices and the cloud in near real-time. The data is stored in a MongoDB collection in a format that is similar to the way it is stored in the local Realm database, making it easy to work with the data using MongoDB query language and tools.
